# SwiftLogging
Simple and effective way to log in debug mode with Swift 2

/**
 Prints the filename, function name, line number and textual representation of `object` and a newline character into
 the standard output if the build setting for "Other Swift Flags" defines `-D DEBUG`.
 
 The current thread is a prefix on the output. <UI> for the main thread, <BG> for anything else.
 
 Only the first parameter needs to be passed to this funtion.
 
 The textual representation is obtained from the `object` using its protocol conformances, in the following
 order of preference: `CustomDebugStringConvertible` and `CustomStringConvertible`. Do not overload this function for
 your type. Instead, adopt one of the protocols mentioned above.
 
 :param: object   The object whose textual representation will be printed. If this is an expression, it is lazily evaluated.
 :param: file     The name of the file, defaults to the current file without the ".swift" extension.
 :param: function The name of the function, defaults to the function within which the call is made.
 :param: line     The line number, defaults to the line number within the file that the call is made.
